 ## Abstract
Are there racial and ethnic gaps in mortgage approval rates throughout the United States mortgage market? This study seeks to measure these gaps using the open Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) data from 2019 through 2021. I used a linear probability model to estimate whether a gap exists while controlling for other variables included in the dataset. The model produced estimates between White and Black applicants to be 4.6 percentage points, White and Asian to be 1.2, White and Hispanic to be 1.9, and White and Other applicants to be 3.2 percentage points. Other literature is also reviewed to further explore these gaps, given the closed dataset. This study suggests that these disparities exist in today's U.S. mortgage market.
